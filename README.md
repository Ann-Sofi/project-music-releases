# Music Releases
On this project we are doing pair-programing and using React for the first time ðŸ’¥. The goal is to use React components to build a page which shows music releases using data from Spotify

## The problem

We started by discussing and deciding how the strucutre of the code should look. What do we want as components? We decided to do several small components and then import hem in to ArtistList. This was because of three reasons: If one component didn't work we thought it would be easier to check for the error. And also because we felt it would make it more clear what the component did. And it would be easier if we want to re-use it for another project
We used map() to iterate over data go get the information on all the albums in the API. We also did a map() over the artists to be able to present all of the artists if there were more than one.
We placed hover effects on the album to show icons and also on the album and artist text.
